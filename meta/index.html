<p>
  <p>This is the Wiklish Hack, a wiki for tracking and sharing hack 
progress. Its current contributors are <a href="http://www.benwr.net">@bwr</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/jpouellet">@jpo</a>.</p>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>The Wiklish Hack is meant to be an ethereal reincarnation of the
"Weeklish Hack", a group that met every once in a while in
Blacksburg, Virginia. Some members have since departed, while
others are still around, but this is meant to be a place
for a small group of people to share what they're working on
or playing with.</p>
<h2 id="organization">Organization</h2>
<p>The wiki is statically generated by <a href="http://urubu.jandecaluwe.com/">Urubu</a>,
and the canonical version lives
<a href="https://github.com/wiklish/wiklish">on GitHub</a> (although it can be easily
viewed or published in a variety of ways).</p>
<p>Site organization is however you want it to be! It's recommended that
(at least for personal projects) you use a personal directory (e.g. <a href="bwr">bwr</a>)
when appropriate.</p>
<h2 id="contributing">Contributing</h2>
<p>Anyone can fork this project and run a similar thing for themselves (such
is the nature of DVCS), but if you'd like to contribute to the canonical
version, feel free to ask a current administrator to add you to the wiklish
organization on Github, or to submit a pull request.</p>
<h3 id="howto">Howto</h3>
<p>Working on this project requires a unix-ish system with
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make">GNU Make</a>, <a href="https://python.org">Python</a>,
and <a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io">Virtualenv</a> installed; the rest is taken care
of when you first run <code>make build</code>.</p>
<p>To build an HTML copy of the site, run <code>make build</code>. This should give you a
directory, <code>_build/</code>, containing the resultant static HTML.</p>
<p>To serve the content locally (and automatically rebuild the site when changes
are made to a <code>.md</code> file), run <code>make serve</code>. <code>^C</code> (or <code>Ctrl-C</code> for you
non-true-believers) should kill the server and the rebuilding service.</p>
<p>If you have commit access to the website, you can run <code>make publish</code> to
push your changes to the real world. It's <em>highly recommended</em> that you only
do this after verifying that your pages look the way you want them, and
are generated correctly. If you run <code>make publish</code> and not everything is
as it should be, you may accidentally push an empty site (and this empty
site will overwrite the current site contents until someone fixes it).</p>
